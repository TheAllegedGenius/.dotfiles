## zsh-plugins
My custom "plugin manager" for zsh. It's just a little script that sources plugin files into my .zshrc and git clones the repo if it doesn't exist. There's also a function for updating all of the plugins even though that's rarely necessary.
## term_colors
This directory contains a custom verison of the iTerm Lovelace theme, where the background color has been changed to pure black. It's otherwise identical.
## sym_setup
A script that creates my symlinks manually (not using stow).
